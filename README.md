## Installation guide and Usage

- First, clone the project files to a directory that has write permissions enabled. This directory should be outside the directories that the you intend to monitor. The necessary settings and variations can be done by editing the "settings.py" file. To start monitoring, copy the paths of the files and directories that needs monitoring into the "watch_list.txt", each on a new line.

The single file monitoring format is as follows:
```
/var/www/html/jets.php
```

The directory monitoring format is as follows which consists of the order:


- directory path, state "true" or "false"  to specify if subdirectories needs to be monitored as well, files extensions that needs to be excluded from the monitoring process separated by "|", the maximum file size in bytes.
